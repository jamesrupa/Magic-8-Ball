# Magic 8 Ball
**Random Answer Generator with a GUI**\
*Created By James Rupa*

## Project Description

The magic 8 ball project was made entirely in a night for a friend and ended up turning out pretty much exactly how I envisioned it. It has a GUI for the user, an input for the user to ask the question and the response will be given to you in a pop up window. I hope you enjoy this quick project that I made and check out some of my other ones.

## Future Plans

Make the GUI a little bit nicer and add more answer for the users.
